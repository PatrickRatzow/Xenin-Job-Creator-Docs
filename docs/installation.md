# Installation
To install the addon you'll first have to install the Xenin Framework. This can be done by adding [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1900562881) to your servers workshop collection. **This method is heavily recommeded**

If that for whatever reason does not work you can download the newest version from [here](https://gitlab.com/sleeppyy/xenin-framework/-/releases) instead.

After this you can simply just drag the addon into your servers addon folder.
